I'll help you understand the JSON structure of your educational dataset so your Replit web app can properly process it. Let me examine the JSON file structure and provide you with the exact schema and processing code.
```bash
python -c "import json; data=json.load(open('educational_videos_refined.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print('JSON Structure:'); print('Top-level keys:', list(data.keys())); print('\\nMetadata keys:', list(data['metadata'].keys())); print('\\nVideo array length:', len(data['videos'])); print('\\nFirst video keys:', list(data['videos'][0].keys())); print('\\nSample video:', json.dumps(data['videos'][0], indent=2)[:1000] + '...')"
```

Now let me create a test script and show you a real example from your dataset:
```bash
python test_json_processing.py
```
